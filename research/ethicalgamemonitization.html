                Video game monetization has evolved from a pay-to-play model where customers pay either a one time or recurring fee to gain access to a game, to a post purchase revenue model with what the industry dubs microtransaction. Microtransactions are defined as a payment made in an application that is used to purchase/unlock additional content with-in the application. With their introduction in mobile games in the early 2000s there has been an increase year after year for other platforms such as  consoles and pc (source the 2010-2014 things). However, what is available to purchase in game varies from title to title, a popular implementation is a pay-to-win style where game progression will be strategically extended so it will take more time than a reasonable player would have to play the game in order to offer a paid way though microtransactions to bypass the useless grinding. Other implementations are linked to obtaining cosmetic items only that don't affect the balance of gameplay which is generally regarded to be an ethical implementation.  The most ethically worrying trend is to add randomization mechanics, more bluntly put to simulate electronic gambiling or whats know as steaking in game currency for the chance of a reward with scheduled drop rates most commonly from loot boxes.

              <div class="body-text">
                Gambiling mechanics that are implemented in video games in the form of loot boxes or random reward schedules purchasable with ingame-currency are becoming increasingly more common in video games for all ages in predatory ways designed to enable players to engage in repeat behaviour. Often these mechanics are implemented in ways to emulate video lottery terminals (VLTS) with loads of activity on screen such as animations that give the illusion of randomness, different colours to represent the rarity of potential, exciting sounds design, and the default option is to ‘retry’. To avoid existing laws that would classify these simulations as actual gambiling publishers will have every purchase win a prize. However, most of these prizes are worth nothing and are non-tradable so therefore is worth nothing (Liu, K. 2019), within the context of the game is still a reward but the same as a loss as a house win in a casino. Since the introduction of lootbox mechanics in mobile games it has found its way into all game genres and platforms including but not limited too, sports games such as FIFA and NHL, first person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, and even games made from licensed Disney intellectual property such as Star Wars Battlefront. Publishers argue that games can be designed with different monetization mechanics in mind but in reality they are often added on as an afterthought making their purpose more obvious leading to negative opinions in the public (Kim, M. 2019).
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                  The negative publicity around monetization mechanics do not deter game publishers to perceive it as necessary to increase revenues, due in main part to increased development costs for AAA games and stagnating price tags. Although it is not on the part of the consumer but a risk that publishers haven't been willing to take in terms of stagnating pricing. Put expretly by Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson in a GameBiz interview “Halo 1 was developed I think by 35-50 people. ... Paying those people, making sure development is paid, is a lot easier than paying 300 people. That's eight or ten times the cost.” (Futter, M. 2019) One of the main reasons for the increase is conveniently left out of the interview questioning. The reason cited is that consumers expectations are consistently increasing to produce more impressive experience and “push the bound of entertainment” resulting in selling full priced copies of the game at a loss (Futter, M. 2019). This is in direct counter to examples like CupHead release by Canadian publisher StudioMDHR which sold over 4 million units with a small development team and minimal costs (Boudreau, I. 2019). There has been sentiment to increase the base price of games for because of hours of entrainment, for example a movie has about 3 hours of entertainment and video games have 10s+ hours of interactive entertainment. The concerns raised are valid and reasons for attempting to increase revenue per copy of the game but, the willingness to embrace predatory ingame monetization tactics in order to create safer revenue streams for shareholders is self inflicted since the expectation isn't something demanded by but rather provided to consumers. 
                </div>
                <div class="body-text">
                  This introduces the major ethical dilemma that exists within large video game publishers, on the one hand attempting to recover cost post purchase especially when consumers can enjoy the experience without paying the full price behind it increases your audience. On the other hand the methods used today to acquire that revenue stream and how they are implemented are predatory in nature designed to take advantage of those most vulnerable who would have protection under current gambiling regulations such as minors or problem gamblers. 
                </div>
                <div class="body-text">
                  The first organization that will be evaluated is Electronic Arts (EA), its infamous for publishing some of the worst offending games in terms of implementing aggressive monetization mechanics in their games, mainline in the form of loot box and pay-to-win. All of EA’s in game monetization strategies revolve around the player purchasing special non-transferable ingame currency, then this in game currency is either used to purchases random draws for better in game items or abilities to use in competitive gameplay. What is alarming is their implementations in games like Star Wars Battlefront to push predatory sales tactics of loot boxes indescrimenty on all market segments. Carefully designed to borrow important aspects from VLTs with the same expected payout schedules and engaging visuals. In titles like dead space 3 EA implements a pay-to-win system where they make the game harder than previous titles in an effort to push as manu casual players as they can to spend on upgrades presumably because of the lack of additional commitment a player is willing to put in. The most worrying factor is that these systems do not discriminate if you are more susceptible to these marketing tactics such as children or problem gamblers, casting the widest nest possible in order to find those who generate the most revenue. 
                </div>
                <div class="body-text">
                When asked to specify how these microtransaction and luck systems work and who they target EA immediately went on the defensive attempting to reframe them as “surprise mechanics” (Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2019), which they state are present in popular titles such as FIFA 2015-2019 and Star Wars BattleFront. Other Predatory implementations of microtransaction do exists in other titles from EA such as Anthem and The SIMS which do not borrow from gambilimg mechanics, they do overuse skinner box like psychological tricks to engage people who are at risk of overspending, more commonly referred to as ‘whales’ in the industry that will spend upwards of $1000s on purchases. These monetization mechanics aren't regulated under legislation and due to this there is no restriction on who they can target leading to the most at risk demographics such as children or persons more prone to gambeling addiction. However, despite some obvious similarities to straight up slot machine EA has not been shy to defending their use of these monetization mechanics in parliamentary inquiries and many press interviews. Even stating they believe their implementations are “quite ethical and quite fun.” making their stance very clear that this is all fine (Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2019). 
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                The current CEO Andrew Wilson who started out as a developer 19 years ago at EA and rose up the corporate ladder, although Wilson is in favour of having monetization mechanics and recognizes them as necessary but does acknowledge there is friction between the good intentions and the imperfect results that comes with the implementations (Futter, M. 2019). Some of this necessity is driven from the massive growth in shareholder value after EA titles adopted predatory microtransaction features. Also that development costs consistently increase with their titles in an attempt to  Wilson has gone as far as to push his company to patch games after launch to mitigate risk and appeal to a wider general audience, citing one of his main concerns is to avoid layoffs (Futter, M. 2019). However, there is heavy reluctance to remove all predatory nature since they have this nice reliance on it for the scale at which they produce their games. This is very telling of EA leadership’s ethical blind spots since they only seem to be concerned with the outcome of maintaining high shareholder value and retaining as many employees as possible without having as much consideration for how they achieve it. 
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                The other organization that will be compared to EA is regarded as one of the leaders in more ethical monetization schemes is Riot Games (Riot).  Riot has published and maintains one of the most popular online free to play games League of Legends with esports tournaments with prize pools of over $74 million and one of the largest esports followings. What sets Riot’s actions apart from other publishers in the space is their caution in monetizing their games and to implement a more treasure hunt like approach to loot boxes where no money is exchanged. One thing they do sell in game is skins for player’s characters that have no effect on the gameplay but do affect the cosmetic wrap on the player for others to see. In addition to that revenue stream Riot leverages their huge community base to sell tickets to community and esports events that it hosts. 
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                Riot has stood out in the esports space and continues to support it in the hope of more growth and revenue potential. In an effort to jump start interest Riot subsidize the pay for professional players in teams for esports. They provided up to $25,000 USD per player in an effort to attract better teams and talent to grow their esports following and legitimacy during the sport’s infancy. Now top players makeover $300,000 USD yearly and bring in their own sponsorship deals helping bringing more attention to events (Heitner, 2018).
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                In terms of loot boxes Riot has introduced them in a fundamentally different way than many of its competitors in the industry. Instead of opting to give the player a use of the box every time they pay its based on how many multiplayer matches you play, after a certain amount you have the ability to open the box which is then followed by a 24 hour cool down period. This feature was introduced in a new game mode with an emphasis on the lootbox being core to the game play and not a revenue generating after thought. From a preliminary look Riots leadership has much more moral focus than the industry average, not only by neglecting to add purchasing capabilities to loot boxes but in their community engagement. By hosting community events such as esport tournaments they use their player base to monetize the game in ways the strengths the community instead of acts as a parasite on them.

                Rights relating to purchases made via micro transactions 
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
	Purchases made using microtransactions aren't protected like regular purchases are, due to the wording in most game End User Licence Agreement (EULA) many consumer rights are revoked from the purchases and treat them much more like licenced contend when ingame stores make no mention of it being a licence than a product. An examples of  revocation was in Roit’s title League of Legends where in a community event called Bilgewater: Burning Tides they had a time sensitive item available for purchase with in game current was later removed from the game with no reason given. These actions are completely allowable in the ELUA and players have no valid method of resource to receive a refund when their purchase isn't available anymore. EA has exercised its EULA with its FIFA titles to ban suspected cheaters without refunding a purchases they have spent in game (King, C. 2017). Leadership isn't interested in remedying situations like this since there is no legal requirement. The wording in EULA’s and by the actions of the organizations it shows that consumers don’t retain ownership over in app purchases and that the actual “purchases” happens when real world dollars is exchanged for in game currency and not when ingame currency is exchanged for items.
</div>
<div class="body-text">
Depending on the studio, games will either be a free to play or paid release. When publishers implement microtransactions in games with a purchase price they can leverage a sunk cost fallacy on players. For example a AAA title usually goes for around $60 USD so spending an additional $5 or an extra 8% for a more full experience. Whereas conversely in a free to play game which has a purchase price of $0 players do not have the same sunk cost so they are either heavily inclined to keep the experience free or they spend what they would have on the purchase price on microtransaction beginning the cycle of sunken cost fallacy. It gets a bit more complicated since in both cases there isn’t a sunk cost since the items can be revoked from you at any time nullifying the value you used to purchase it. 
</div>
<div class="body-text">
	Both organizations approach the in game item ownership the same even those purchased with actual currency. Riot is even guilty of removing certain items without giving players notice as in accordance with their EULA (King  2017). 
</div>
  <div class="header-text">
Regulatory Challenges around monetization
</div>
<div class="body-text">
Historically gambiling has been regulated so only adults have access to it and is tax sufficiently so that even though people are making a profit off a morally ambiguous activity it still generates a benefit to society. Even back to the introduction of vlts in the US in 1887 (Liu, K. 2019) up until 1910 most machines accepted cash and dispense cash. In an effort to avoid regulations around their use after 1910 many locations converted their machines to take tokens instead of cash coins and to render commodity items. Later when regulations relaxed in 1931 they had put in extra rules such as having to post odds for win rates. 
</div>
<div class="body-text">
This parallels in comparison to EA’s approach where they are happy to implement workarounds so they don't fit current classifications. "We do think the way that we have implemented these kinds of mechanics ...[ and are ]... actually quite ethical and quite fun, quite enjoyable to people," said Kerry Hopkins VP of Legal Affairs for EA when inquiring about the downsides (Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2019). With the similarities to the evolution of the VLT industry and their attempts to sidestep regulation attempts and EA’s leadership’s behaviour. Another example of EA’s leadership team having an ethical blind spot in a display of denial. 
</div>
<div class="body-text">
When slot machines transitioned from purley mechanical to computer controlled in the early 90s there was a shift to how they machines operated, rather than just having a strait up reward schedule that would be deterministically given out and machines could now use pattern recognition to enable the gamblers to become more engaged and spend more money (Liu, K. 2019). With all of EA’s Games such as FIFA being online so all of their data is collected by EA to aggregate through with data analytic techniques its similar to think that they could implement the same sort of encouragement systems around their randomized mechanics. In fact EA has a patent for a matchmaking system that would encourage players to spend more on microtransactions (Marr, Kaplan, Lewis. 2017). It’s no longer a question of if they use data generated by their platforms to specifically target certain individuals, its to what extend do they  pick targets and what behavioural traits they look for.
</div>
<div class="body-text">
Having an aggregating all this data also leads to privacy concerns since with the information an organization could target individuals who show the same behaviours as problem gamblers and since there is no current regulations surrounding target them heavier than other players  it's a safe way to ensure a revenue stream.  “We would have data on the number of matches but we dont keep specific metrics on play times….. the telemetry system is looking for things like did they play today and if they won…”(Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2019).  EA’s leadership is being disingenuous here since they when they say  they don't have that data specifically when they can use the data they capture to recreate the rest of it. With the evidence of the patent above its really easy to see that it isn’t an ongoing debate within the organization whether or not this is going to be the dominant strategy .
</div>
<div class="body-text">
Unsurprisingly when questioned about whether or not they believe that these random reward schedule items (loot boxes) we not gambiling in their eyes because it skirted within the laws that defined what gambiling was and used sanitizing language in an effort to change the meaning. From their behaviour they want to distance themselves as far away from any regulator language in the hopes that they won't become regulated like the process VLT went through. 
</div>
<div class="header-text">
Effects on Industry
</div>
<div class="body-text">
The implementation of microtransactions in online video games introduces players to social pressures that can be or have the appearance of being alleviated through the use of different in-application purchases. From a Bosian study done on the effect microtransactions have on the industry (Nenad, T. 2017) have far reaching social complications in competitive video games. The main example is the use of cheat codes in single player games, they are often used to help the play gain power ups that will help them play better. In multiplayer games this doesn't really exist and people who attempt to do things like that are usually given a temporary or permanent ban. Microtransactions can provide a way around that in a pay to win method , where players can get skip acquiring skills and get better items to be more competitive.  Nenad argues that this system can create conditions that exerts certain social pressures on players to purchase more to stay even more competitive, or to obtain specific cosmetic only ingame items. Developers and Publishers like to exploit this social proofing phenomena , this is most prevalent with cosmetics or skin purchases as players without seeing players with, triggering a monkey see monkey do attitude. It’s a very effective way to introduce sales pressure implicitly though store implementation.
</div>
<div class="body-text">
	Games as an interactive experience are also getting exponentially bigger with larger teams which is outpacing market growth contributing to an increase in dollar spent per copy of game sold. Thi is pushing publishers like EA to look for additional revenue sources beyond the initial purchase price of the game. It’s a double edged sword, ever since the implementation of “surprise mechanics” in FIFA ultimate team shareholders saw the revenue potential and began to push for implementation in all of EA titles. EA’s stock has grown continually with growth in earnings as well, being a publicly traded company leadership will be more inclined to generate more company value at other expenses. With this additional value EA has purchased many other developers and integrating them into their organization, which they can then implement their own monetization visions in the games converting more of the industry to their values. 	`

                  Both EA and Riot should take the initiative to work with regulatory bodies on created concrete regulations what benefit both them and society like existing gambiling regulation. Right now EA’s leadership is taking advantage of the current regulatory climate and denying that they resemble existing gambiling at all. The industry as a whole is moving towards relying on these kinds of transactions and purchases to fund development and regulations that are too harsh could kill the initiatives altogether. Letting greed blind them from searching for an ethical alternative such as Riot has done is creating a history of just dodging the law and claiming to be ethically clear is going to hurt the industry as a whole, especially because of how large a player EA is. 
                </div>
                <div class="body-text">
                  Outlined in a study done in Australia on ethical implementation of  video game monetization they lay out a blueprint for steps that can be taken to ensure it (King, Delfabbro 2018). Most of the recommendations involves removing the or dulling the mechanics down so they resemble less traditional gambiling and only let a limited subset of the features will be implemented. Most of the advice is applicable to EA’s current implementation and would serve as a good guideline for others attempting to do the same, the most important recommendation is to redesign the audio-visual effects for opening the ‘loot boxes’. This change is easy to see as the audio-visual effects are designed directly from slot machines to invoke people to keep going, from current strategy it is unlikely that leadership would go against the wishes of stakeholders and ultimately the company. Other recommendations include introducing spending limits per day so people cant go overboard or introduce an extra step in the purchase process to remove many of the impulse purchases.

                  EA’s leadership to benefit from these recommendations needs to recognize that their current approach to development is flawed and supported by exploiting people susceptible to overspending in gambiling. As much as their CEO Mr. Wilson tries to justify that they need to use monetization strategies like this because games are becoming too expensive to develop. This is similar to the argument for creating a loss leader to eventually make it up with additional revenue post purchase, except in this case they use very predatory tactics to achieve this and claim it as ethical. Any pointing out of wrongdoing is instantly met with really poorly masked apologies filled with sanitized language like ‘surprise mechanics’ or downplaying how much the use of system analytics is apart of how they sell microtransaction. EA’s leadership needs to take the first step and acknowledge that their predatory monetization tactics are unethical and point the finger at shareholders for their role as well. Until a change in vision like that happens groupthink will continue to put group pressure on any dissenters unless an executive officer is willing to uphold their integrity.

                  Riot has done good in this regard since they have taken on the recommendations of implementing a loot box system based on player skill / play time. Instead of charging in game currency for loot boxes in a new game TFT during the summer of 2019 , players must play 5 games before they can open the loot box and then there is a 24 hour cool down period (Riot Dev Corner. 2019). In the same  Dev Conner  post in the Q and A for their changes, they gave the best most straightforward response “we need to achieve that goal in a way that feels fair and fun for everyone. We’re hoping this is a big step in that direction.” This is the most clear sign that their actions and statements compliment each other rather than contradict, Riot has the proper vision to lead its teams to responsibly and ethically implement monetization features. Riot’s leadership has already taken steps to more towards more ethical implementations of monetization mechanics and loot boxes in their games and are an example that the industry as a whole should strive for.

                  EA is regarded as the boogie man for video game monetization which it has so clearly labeled itself that with its actions. Their main vision as an organization is to acquire as much revenue per copy of the game as possible using any legal means necessary. Their leadership has shown through its actions and contradictory statements that from an organizational standpoint it is culture to think this way and most likely considered normal behaviour to think about how to target individuals who are more susceptible to spend more like a las vegas casino.

                  Monetization in the video game industry is a scatter shot of different approaches from attempting to gain all required revenue from advertisements or the initial purchase price to publishers implementing gambiling style mechanics or even in extreme cases strait up slot machines. With large publishers like EA treating their implementation as the “ethical and fun alternative” is very damaging to the industry as a whole since when regulations catch up they could end up empeeding good experiments with these mechanics like Riot has Pioneered impending overall growth in the industry.
