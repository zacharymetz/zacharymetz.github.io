                Video game monetization has evolved from a pay-to-play model where customers pay either a one time or recurring fee to gain access to a game, to a post purchase revenue model with what the industry dubs microtransaction. Microtransactions are defined as a payment made in an application that is used to purchase/unlock additional content with-in the application. With their introduction in mobile games in the early 2000s there has been an increase year after year for other platforms such as  consoles and pc (source the 2010-2014 things). However, what is available to purchase in game varies from title to title, a popular implementation is a pay-to-win style where game progression will be strategically extended so it will take more time than a reasonable player would have to play the game in order to offer a paid way though microtransactions to bypass the useless grinding. Other implementations are linked to obtaining cosmetic items only that don't affect the balance of gameplay which is generally regarded to be an ethical implementation.  The most ethically worrying trend is to add randomization mechanics, more bluntly put to simulate electronic gambiling or whats know as steaking in game currency for the chance of a reward with scheduled drop rates most commonly from loot boxes.  
            </div><div class="body-text">
Gambiling mechanics that are implemented in video games in the form of loot boxes or random reward schedules purchasable with ingame-currency are becoming increasingly more common in video games for all ages in predatory ways designed to enable players to repeat. Often these mechanics are implemented in ways to emulate video lottery terminals with loads of activity on screen such as, animations that give the illusion of randomness, different colours to represent the rarity of potential, exciting sounds design, and the default option is to ‘retry’. To avoid existing laws that would classify these simulations as actual gambiling publishers will have every purchase win a prize. However, most of these prizes are worth nothing and are non-tradable so therefore is worth nothing(cite one of the research paper), within the context of the game is still a reward but the same as a loss as a house win in a casino. Since the introduction of lootbox mechanics in mobile games it has found its way into all game genres and platforms including but not limited too, sports games such as FIFA and NHL, first person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, and even games made from licensed Disney intellectual property such as Star Wars battlefront. Publishers argue that games can be designed with different monetization mechanics in mind but in reality they are often added on as an after though making their purpose more obvious leading to negative opinions in the public .(source)
</div><div class="body-text">
	The negative clout around monetization mechanics do not deter game publishers to perceive it as necessary to increase revenues, due in main part to increased development costs for AAA games and stagnating price tags. Although it is not on the part of the consumer but a risk that publishers haven't been willing to take in terms of stagnating pricing. Put expretly by Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson “Halo 1 was developed I think by 35-50 people. ... Paying those people, making sure development is paid, is a lot easier than paying 300 people. That's eight or Ten times the cost.” One of the main reasons for the increase is conveniently left out of the interview questioning. One of the main reasons cited is that consumers expectations are consistently increasing to produce increasingly more impressive experience and “push the bound of entertainment” resulting in selling full priced copies of the game at a loss (news source). This is in direct counter to examples like CupHead release by Canadian publisher StudioMDHR which sold over 4 million units with a small development team and minimal costs(wiki source). There has been sentiment to increase the base price of games for the reason of hours of entrainment, for example a movie has about 3 hours of entertainment a video games has 10s+ hours of interactive content. The concerns raised are valid and reasons for attempting to increase revenue per copy of the game but, the willingness to embrace predatory ingame monetization tactics in order to create safer revenue streams for shareholders is self inflicted since the expectation isn't something demanded by but rather provided to consumers. 
</div><div class="body-text">
	This introduces the major ethical dilemma that exists within large video game publishers, on the one hand attempting to recover cost post purchase especially when consumers can enjoy the experience without paying the full price behind it increases your audience. The other hand the methods used today to acquire that revenue stream and how they are implemented are predatory in nature designed to take advantage of those most vulnerable who would have protection under current gambiling regulations such as minors or problem gamblers. 
</div><div class="body-text">
	The first organization that will be evaluated is Electronic Arts (EA), its infamous for publishing some of the worst offending games in terms of implementing aggressive monetization mechanics in their games in the form of loot box and pay to win. All of EA’s in game monetization strategies revolve around the player purchasing special non-transferable ingame currency, then this in game currency is either used to purchases random draws for better in game items or abilities to use in competitive gameplay or purchases upgrades. What makes their implementations in games like Star Wars battlefront is how predatory their implementation actually is, carefully designed to borrow important aspects from VLTs with the same expected payout all using a theme to keep it hidden. In titles like dead space 3 EA implements a pay-to-win system where they make the game multiples harder than previous titles in an effort to push as manu casual players as they can to spend on upgrades presumably because of the lack of additional commitment a player is willing to put in. The most worrying factor is that these systems do not discriminate if you are more susceptible to not realizing what is happening, casting the widest nest possible in order to find those who generate the most revenue. 
</div><div class="body-text">
When asked to specify who and how these microtransaction+luck systems work and who they target EA immediately went on the defensive attempting to reframe them as “surprise mechanics”, which are present in popular titles such as FIFA 2015-2019 and Star Wars BattleFront. Other Predatory implementations of microtransaction do exists in other titles from EA such as ( ............. and ………….) which do not borrow from gambilimg mechanics they do overuse skinner box like psychological tricks to engage people who are at risk of overspending, more commonly referred to as ‘whales’ in the industry that will spend upwards of $1000s on purchases. These monetization mechanics aren't regulated under legislation and due to this there is no restriction on who they can target leading to the most at risk demographics such as children or persons more prone to gambeling addiction. However, despite some obvious similarities to ()  EA has not been shy to defending their use of these monetization mechanics in parliamentary inquiries and many press interviews. Even stating they believe their implementations are “quite ethical and quite fun.” making their stance very clear that this is all fine. 
</div><div class="body-text">
The current CEO Andrew Wilson who started out as a developer 19 years ago and rose up the corporate ladder, although Willson is in favour of having monetization mechanics and recognizes them as necessary but does acknowledge there is friction between the good intentions and the imperfect results that comes with the implementations. Some of this necessity is driven from the massive growth in shareholder value after EA titles adopted predatory microtransaction features. Also that development costs consistently increase with their titles in an attempt to  Willson has gone as far as to push his company to patch games after launch to mitigate risk and appeal to a wider general audience, citing one of his main concerns is to avoid layoffs.. However, there is heavy reluctance to remove all predatory nature since they have this nice reliance on it for the scale at which they produce their games.  
-talk about how their leadership is insular, only really care baout thier group not the main group, pretty evident from this , they care about the welfare of his or her immediate group the company in forms of layoffs verse 
</div><div class="body-text">
The other organization that will be compared to EA is regarded as one of the leaders in more ethical monetization schemes is Riot Games (Riot).  Riot has published and maintains one of the most popular online free to play games with esports tournaments with prize pools of over $74 million and one of the largest followings. What sets Riot’s actions apart from other publishers in the space was their caution in monetizing their games and more treasure hunt like approach to loot boxes where no money is exchanged. One thing they do sell in game is skins for in game player characters that have no effect on the gameplay on the cosmetic wrap on the player for others to see. In addition to that revenue stream Riot leverages their huge community base to sell tickets to community and e sports events that it hosts. 
</div><div class="body-text">
Riot has stood out in the esports space and continues to support in the hope of more growth and revenue from it, one of the ways they do this is to subsidize the pay for professional players in teams for esports. They provided up to $25,000 usd per player in an effort to attract better teams and talent to grow their esports following and legitimacy.
</div><div class="body-text">
In terms of loot boxes Riot has introduced loot boxes in a fundamentally different way than many of its competitors in the industry. Instead of opting to give the player a use of the box every time they pay its based on how many multiplayer matches you play, after a certain amount you have the ability to open the box which is then followed by a 24 hour cool down period. This feature was introduced in a new game mode with an emphasis on the lootbox being core to the game play and not a revenue generating after thought 
(get something from riot leader ship that syas they are doing good lol )
